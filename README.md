## Waterfall Model  
The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model  
It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
### Waterfall Model-Design  
In 'The Waterfall' approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.
